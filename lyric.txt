You can't just give it away
Like it means nothing
Love is in this gateway
You win something

I'm tired of being
On the outside
I want to know
What it's like
I'm tired of seeing
All the sights

I want to feel
Us collide
Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
Your love pushes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide

All the games we play
You're fooling nobody
If it makes you feel good
That your hurting somebody

I'm tired of being
On the outside
I want to know
What it's like
I'm tired of seeing
All the sights

I want to feel
Us collide

Your love washes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide
Your love pushes over
Like a tidal wave
I feel the impact
As we collide

I feel the impact
As we collide
